Extracted from the nuts of the argan tree (<em>Argania spinosa</em>), native to the southwestern regions of Morocco, this oil has been used for centuries by the Berber people for both culinary and cosmetic purposes. Its rich composition makes it an exceptional natural resource with applications in skin care, hair care, health, and even cooking.",
